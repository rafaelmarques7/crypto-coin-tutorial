# Cypto Coin tutorial

In this repo, I will create a blockchain to simulate a cryptocurrency. The goal of this is simply to learn more about these technologies.

So, how does a cryptocurrency based on blockchain work?
* There are `Transactions`, which describe the transfer of funds from one person to another.
    * transactions require a `payer`, a `payee`, and an `ammount`
    * payers and payee are identified by their public keys (refer to Notes to find out more about this)
* There are `Blocks`, which contain:
    * a list of transactions (although in this example we may use just one transaction per block to simplify things)
    * an identifier of the `previousHash` - this links alls blocks, forming a blockchain
    * a `date`
    * a `Nonce` - a random number (see notes)
* There is one `Chain`:
    * there is one and only one chain
    * the chain contains a list of (transaction) `Blocks`
    * you can only add to the chain, you can never remove from it
* a `Wallet`, which:
    * is tied to one user
    * has a `private key`, which should be kept private, and is used to sign transactions
    * has a `public key`, which is public and anyone can use to verify the signature of a transaction
    * ?? has a particular `balance`

## Notes

### Signing transactions:

* each wallet (user) in a blockchain has two keys, a public key and a private key.
    * a private key must be kept private by the owner of it.
    * the public key can be made public to anyone.
* the private key is used to sign a transaction. 
    ```typescript
    generateSignature(transaction, privateKey) => signature
    ```
* anyone can look at a particular transaction - which has a particular signature - and use any public key to verify if that signature was generated by the owner of that public key. 
    ```ts
    validateSignature(signature, publicKey) => boolean
    ```
    * What we have is a function, let's name it `validateSignature`, that takes two arguments `(signature, publicKey)` and returns a boolean (true/false)
    * it will return true if the signature was generated by the private key associated with that public key, and false otherwise
